My reimplementation of the mandelbrot code provided by lecturers of
CMP202.

## To be done

1. Change from black and white image to colour.
1. Implement threading.
1. Performance optimisation.
1. Figure out sdl2 to show mandelbrot generation as it happens.

## Improvements

1. Less nested looping, [Treat a 1D array as if it was 2D](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/212808/treating-a-1d-data-structure-as-2d-grid).
1. Allow user to specify custom resolution.
1. Better file structuring (split into main.cpp, mandelbrot.[c/h]pp)
